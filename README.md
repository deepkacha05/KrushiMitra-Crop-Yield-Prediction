## 📖 Project Overview

**KrushiMitra** is an AI-powered Crop Yield Prediction System developed using **Machine Learning** and **Streamlit**.

The application predicts crop yield based on agricultural parameters such as:

- 🌍 State
- 🏙 District
- 🌾 Crop
- 🌤 Season
- 📅 Crop Year
- 🌱 Area

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end Machine Learning workflow including:

- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment using Streamlit
